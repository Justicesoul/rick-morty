## Project Description

The project has two sections: characters and locations. Both sections are paginated and have text input for search, but the search logic is different. In characters section possible to search through all characters by additional API request, but in location section the search is performed for a specific page without API request.
In both sections it is possible to relocate to a personal page of particular character or location.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
